You will receive a link to sign up for an Auth0 account with BigID. This will allow you to access our documentation portal, https://docs.bigid.com. Please let me know if you do not receive this email.

The support site is not required for this exercise, please disregard if a link is received to the site.

Please use the following to download the images if you are unable to download from the docs site:  

Helm charts are included in the "Compose (contains compose directory files)" link

Install BigID in the provided lab environment

A clean Kubernetes server, pre-configured with all the dependencies to install BigID. You are also welcome to use your own, if preferred. The provided lab and license are valid through 10/04/2024.

An initial screen presenting "Your lab is loading..." is expected until you progress in the lab exercise via SSH.

It is recommended that you push images to a private registry that you host that is accessible by the node(s), or load/import your images into the node(s) supported container-runtime.

You will need to set the UI service to Nodeport with an internal port of 443 and a NodePort of 30443

CPU and Memory requests should be reduced to 100m and 1Gi for all pods minus the following:

Mongo - default

MQ - default

Scanner - 2 cpu 4Gi

Correlator 1 cpu 2Gi

There are two ways to deploy MongoDB:

Externally (outside of the helm deploy either as a standalone DB or containerized - this method is typically used for production)

Internally (deployed as part of the helm deploy - this method is typically used in sandboxes/labs).

Each method above has a different section under the mongodb section of the values.yaml file.

Create and onboard a Data Source

Spin up a MySQL instance on the same machine

Import mock data:

The mock dataset contains ~100,000 identities sliced up into CSV files which can be imported into MySQL.

The IDSOR file is intended for use as a Correlation Training Set.

Link to the zip of mock data to use during the lab: 

https://bigid-servicescf.s3.amazonaws.com/Lab+dummy+data/100k+mock+identities_csv.zip

Onboard the data source to BigID






CREATE USER 'ubuntu'@'bigid-small-populated' IDENTIFIED BY 'mysql';

LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.csv' INTO TABLE tablename;


helm install bigid -f values.yaml . -n new


This is meant to be an exercise so please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions or hit a roadblock. Please let me and Alex know when you are ready for a lab review any time next week.
